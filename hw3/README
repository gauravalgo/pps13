README for hw3


Assignemtn 1:
=============

make clean && make ass1 && ./ass1.o 100

Where the parameter is the number of baby birds to spawn.


Assignment 2:
==============

make clean && make ass2 && ./ass2.o 10 25

The first parameter is number of bees collectiong honey
the second parameter is the maximum size of the pot to fill before waking the bear.

This is pretty unfair. The bees collect but dont get to eat!! Damn it. But seriousliy, i think all the threads get an even amount of time over time. The same with assignment 1.
