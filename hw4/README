Assignment 1.

Space Fueling Station
=====================

Spacecrafts can be of 3 different kinds.
Stelth: consume quantum fluids.
Fast:   consume quantum and nitrofuel
Small:  consume nitrofuel only


Ships have different actions:
Flying (consumes fuel)
queing (waitng for a spot at the station, dont cnsume fuel)
docked (is beeing served by the station. This takes some time.)

Refuelingships go between earth and the station.
They also queue for a spot at the station. They can only empty
the cargo if the station has room for it otherwise they wait.

earth is located 70 distance units away. Fuelingships travell 1 unit per "tick", 200ms.
To start the application use:

make all && java pps/Main 5 10000 5000 25

it takes 4 parameters:
----------------------
Help for Fuling Spacestation Simulator
Homework 4 in PPS13, KTH
----------------------
How to use
Parameters:
1. Number of slots in the station
2. Max liters of nitrogen in the spacestation
3. Max liters of quantum fluids in spacestation
3. number of vehicles in the universe

The above example of paramters works pretty well.

The application also starts 4 refueling ships. 
These carry 5000nitro, or 2000 quantum or 1000nitro + 1000 quantum.

So if you have less then 1000 of any of the fuels in the station your gonna have a bad time.

Ships consume one unit per "tick" which is set to 200ms, if they are flying. If they are queing the do not consume any amount at all.

The output from the program:

[Station] 6318/10000 3923/5000 slots: 0/6
[Refuel-1] Queued 50/100(5000 + 0)

[Refuel-3] on way from station 83/100(0 + 0)
[Refuel-4] on way from station 72/100(0 + 0)

In this you can clearly see what the ships are doing, what type they are and what that type consumes.
Stelas for example consumes quantum fluid as indicated by the q.
