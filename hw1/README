or with parameters

first parameter is size of the matrix. it will generate a 2000x2000 matrix populated with random rumbers between 0 - 98
the second parameter is numbers of threads.

It will output the sum of the matrix. Min and max value, and the respiective location as x,y coordiantes.

it will also output the time it took to complete.
